Here is the lightcurve plot from https://dev.pipeline.vast-survey.org/sources/34260695/#measurementsHeader:

Now what I want is a plot showing when each of these observations occurred in J1755-2527's pulse phase. I've downloaded the data containing the start time of each of these observations to [[vast/VAST-Pipeline-Source-ID-34260695.csv]], also obtainable from the above link.
