# ASKAP J175534.9âˆ’252749.1 is an LPT!

Upon the detection of J1755-2527 in GPM2024, we are planning to publish a short paper reporting this source as an LPT. This builds on the original detection of a pulse reported by [Dobie et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.535..909D/abstract).

# Data sets

The data that will go into the paper comes from three telescopes: MWA, ASKAP, and MeerKAT. Data sets that are not too big are stored here. *All* data sets with detections, however, are listed in the below table:

| Datetime (UTC) | Duration | Telescope | Obs ID | Detection? | Notes |
| :------------: | :------: | :-------: | :----: | :--------: | :---- |
| 2023-01-21 | | ASKAP | SB47253 | Y | [Dobie et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.535..909D/abstract) |

# Non-detections

## ASKAP

Here is Dougal's plot of which periods were originally ruled out by non-detections in VAST
